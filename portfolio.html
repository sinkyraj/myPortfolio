        <p>In 2016 I visited Hawaii. The Hawaiian Islands are beautiful, heavenly, peaceful islands that have one of the world’s most active volcanoes and the earth’s tallest sea mountain ideal for a Hawaii vacation. The islands are
        the youngest geological formations in the world and also the youngest state of the United States. Hawaii is the birthplace of surfing, hula dancing and the Hawaiian Regional Cuisine which is a fusion of Hawaii’s ethnic flavours and international gastronomy. The state is made up of a chain of six islands that all have their
        own unique personality and different attractions to discover on a Hawaii vacation.</p>

        <p>Think of a sports car. No matter what age you are, it is an immutable fact that the origins of the car that you're thinking of is firmly rooted in the '50s. British marques like MG, Triumph, Austin Healey, and
         Jaguar established their presence in the United States during that single decade. Likewise, Porsche, Mercedes-Benz and Volkswagen stormed our beaches less than a decade after Normandy and the Battle of the Bulge.
        Italian makers like Ferrari, Maserati, and Alfa Romeo, while not yet household names, pushed their tin onto well-heeled Americans and filled the top spots on racing grids.</p>

        <p>Actually, The Falls are a sensational Natural Wonder. Positively spectacular. And, there are so many ways to enjoy them, including just wandering up and down the walkways. It's a modern engineering wonder that the water is
         "held back" (or you wouldn't be able to see anything for the mist), which also miminizes erosion.</p>
